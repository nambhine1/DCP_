The main code is available in this so if you want to run the application code make sure that you have installed the opencv in your environment otherwise you can not run this program

If you have not install the opencv follow this step

After installation of the opencv library you can run the program using the following comand :



1. >$  g++ test.cpp guidedfilter.cpp darkchannel.cpp airlight.cpp dcp.cpp recover.cpp transmission.cpp -o ./dehaze `pkg-config --libs --cflags opencv`


2. >$ ./dehaze
